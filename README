MultiCacheSim is a cache simulator designed to be used with 
memory access traces obtained with Pin: 
https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/pintool. It
has been optimized for performance and can process large inputs
(100s of GB) in a few hours depending on configuration.

FEATURES
--------

* Configurable size, associativity, and line size
* MOESI protocol simulation for multiple caches
* Tracking of miss and data source statistics
* NUMA statistics are maintained based off of a fist-touch policy
   and configurable page size
* Virtual-to-physical address translation
* Prefetcher "plugins"
   - Adjacent line prefetcher
   - Sequential prefetcher (similar to AMD's L1 prefetcher)
* LRU replacement policy

COMPILATION
-----------

Simply run "make" to compile the simulator with the example driver
program (main.cpp). If you are modifying the simulator, use the
DEBUG flags in the Makefile which enables run-time error checking.

Compilation requires a compiler supporting c++11

USAGE
-----

See main.cpp for an example of using the simulator. The basic
steps are:
1. Create a vector mapping thread IDs to NUMA domains,
      where the index into the vector represents the TID
2. Create a SeqPrefetch (sequential prefetching similar to AMD L1
      prefetcher) or AdjPrefetch (adjacent line prefetcher) if
      wanted.
3. Create a SingleCacheSystem or MultiCacheSystem object using the 
      constructor, which takes:
      the vector from step 1, the size of a cache line in bytes, 
      the number of cache lines, the associativity, 
      whether to count compulsory misses, whether to translate addresses,
      and the number of caches/NUMA domains (for the MultiCacheSystem).
4. Call System::memAccess for each memory access, in order,
      passing the address, read or write (as an 'R' or 'W'
      character), and the TID of the accessing thread.
5. Read the statistics from the System object

The assumed page size can be changed in misc.h, and the prefetch width
for the SeqPrefetch class can be changed in prefetch.h (default 3 lines).

The driver example in main.cpp works with the output from the
ManualExamples/pinatrace pin tool.

MULTI-PROCESS WORKLOADS
-----------------------

To use the simulator with a multi-process workload, only the driver
program needs to be modified.

First, give each of your processes a unique ID starting with 0 and
increasing by 1 (mimicking TIDs), and use it as the TID in the steps
above.

Since the same virtual address in different processes actually refers
to different physical addresses, we need a way to differentiate them
in the simulator. To do this we take advantage of the fact that only
the least significant 48 bits of an address are used in practice:
address |= TID << (7*8);
This places the TID in first byte of the address, ensuring that
addresses are unique among processes.

If the workload uses a shared memory region, find the range for the
region. If an address lies within the range, do not modify the
address as described above, thus making all addresses in the shared
range actually shared among processes.
